After exams are over,<br>
We get rid of our studies.<br>
Just sing and dance and enjoy;<br>
And play with your buddies.<br><br>
I will go into malls and shops<br>
And big big restaurants.<br>
I will take with me my parents<br>
And also uncle and aunt.<br><br>
No pencil,no paper in hand,<br>
Only we've to do is play,play,play.<br>
We can play with bat and ball.<br>
And toys and also clay.<br><br>
We get a long summer, vacation,<br>
For a long ,long time.<br>
We eat mangoes and watermelons<br>
Muskmelons and lime.<br><br>
There are many,more things to do.<br>
After the exams are over,<br>
We have time to see the passing cars,<br>
And aircrafts that hover.<br><br>
But most important of all,<br>
Is that we overcome tension,<br>
We also drive away things like<br>
Books,pens and depression.<br><br>
But after the vacation is over,<br>
We start a new year.<br>
We have to welcome back the books<br>
As exams will come nearer.<br></font>
