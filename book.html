<center>Oh,you are the best source of knowledge book,<br>
You are hanging on the last hook.<br>
The one who took,<br>
You from the last nook,<br>
Would get more and more knowledge;<br>
without any distraction or wedge.<br>
Your words like river flow,<br>
Sometimes high,sometimes low;<br>
The rythm your words sing,<br>
Can make anyone a king.<br>
Oh,and your pictures are very fine<br>
Like sweet fruits of pine.<br></font>
