You are very useful,oh sister,<br>
To brother,you are as king's minister.<br><br>
You tie me a wonderful rakhi.<br>
Of colours red,orange or khakhi.<br><br>
Of course,you are a bit small,<br>
But you attend to my every call.<br><br>
You always give me advice on right,<br>
Be it be day or night.<br><br>
And you are very beautiful,<br>
As well as very useful.<br></font>
