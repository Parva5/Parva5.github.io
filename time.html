<h1 align=center>I like that time</h1>
<font size=5><center>
When in the morning rises the sun,<br>
And I have my bun;<br>
When the day becomes hot<br>
Everybody sleep on their coat.<br>
I feel like singing in the mike<br>
As this is the time I like.<br><br>
When I see a farmer in the day<br>
Going to the field on his way.<br>
To make the grains sprout<br>
On their way to out.<br>
I feel like singing in the mike<br>
As this is the time I like.<br><br>
While cows in the shed bellow<br>
While eating the hay in yellow;<br>
And when I see a woman in red,<br>
Stitching with the needle and thread;<br>
I feel like singing in the mike<br>
As this is the time I like.<br>
