<h1 align=center>Prayer for my home</h1>
<font size=5><center>
Home ,my sweet home,<br>
At its enterance ,there is a beautiful dome.<br>
As for prayer ,I'd like to pray,<br>
For love and peace to always stay.<br>
And also joy, merriment and gay;<br>
Happiness and flowers of may.<br>
I want some things out of my house,<br>
That is sorrow and timid ,scrawling mouse.<br>
Also storm ,cyclone ,rain and wind,<br>
And evil spirits ,you'd better mind!<br>
This is what for my house I pray,<br>
For good things to always stay.<br>
