Grammar,Grammar,Grammar....<br>
It's a wonderful name!<br>
Grammar,Grammar,Grammar....<br>
It has a wide-spread fame.<br><br>
There are many of its kinds,<br>
But the most famous is nouns;<br>
You must be knowing its value<br>
It's worth a thousand ounce!<br><br>
The other main type<br>
Of Grammar is verbs,<br>
It is known to be its heartbeat<br>
And fierce as cubs.<br><br>
Oh,the noun describing words<br>
Are very well known as adjectives.<br>
They add meaning to sentence<br>
Like blasting,terrific explosives.<br><br>
Let us study some examples<br>
As noun's example is weak<br>
I also have one other word<br>
And that is duck's beak.<br><br>
Now,let's have some words<br>
Describing noun as for strength<br>
We also have many words<br>
Another example is length.<br><br>
The sentence which is part of it<br>
Has got parts like subject.<br>
But it also has another part<br>
Yes,and that part is object.<br><br>
Grammar,you will be very useful<br>
Till we pass the twelfth grade.<br>
But you will stay forever with us<br>
To you,we will not bade.<br></font>
