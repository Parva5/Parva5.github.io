<h1 align=center>Trees</h1>
<center><font size=5>
The trees,you are,swaying in the wind,<br>
Oh,and you are very selfless and kind;<br>
You give us food and shelter;<br>
So that no one runs helter-skelter;<br>
The wood given by your trunk,<br>
Is very useful in making the bunk.<br>
Your branches sometimes are covered with thorns,<br>
Sometimes they give us delicious corns.<br>
Your juicy fruits hang high,<br>
That we can't jump so high with our thigh.<br>
And your food preparing leaf,<br>
Is your greatest belief.<br>
And fruits your flower bear,<br>
Are sometimes common,sometimes rare.<br></font>
