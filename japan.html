<h1 align=center>Earthquake in Japan - 2011</h1>
<font size=5><center>
The earth rocked and the waves rose high,<br>
The fleeing people had no time to sigh.<br>
Such earthquake was faced by Japan,<br>
Which indicated nature hasn't got any ban;<br>
Bridges and buildings came crashing down<br>
Due to the water with lava brown.<br>
The water destroyed rails and highways.<br>
T'will take long time to rebuild ,prime minister says,<br>
The country known for many an earthquake,<br>
This time had no measures to take.<br>
Many properties were destroyed and lives were lost,<br>
And to government, it was great cost.<br>
The nuclear reactor burst with bang,<br>
On the roofs ,helpless people clang.<br>
"No such disaster again",to God I pray,<br>
Which would make buildings heave and sway.<br></font>
