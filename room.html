<h1 align=center>My room</h1>
<font size=5><center>
Like a complete mess is my room<br>
Even though the servant sweeps through the broom.<br>
In the corner of my room is my study table<br>
On which there are many books with label.<br>
Beside the study table,is my cupboard<br>
Where I have my childhood toys hoard.<br>
Also there are beds,in number of twos<br>
Accompanied by small cupboard,where I keep my books.<br>
On side of cupboard,facing my table<br>
Stuck there is a large wallpaper.<br>
Also on my table I have a small clock<br>
On the door of my cupboard is the key hanging to lock.<br>
There is a beautiful bedsheet spread,<br>
On each of my two beds.<br>
And I like relaxing in such a room,<br>
Where there is no entry for doom!<br></font>
