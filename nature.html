Oh,you are so beautiful,nature!<br>
You never do the torture;<br>
Everyone in front of you knelt<br>
Because you give leather for belt.<br>
Your trees give us wood;<br>
Which is helpful in making our hood.<br>
You give us iron which is formed into bars,<br>
It is very useful for making the cars.<br>
You let anyone make noise<br>
As you have no other choice.<br>
The hive made by humming bees,<br>
On your lushy,green trees,<br>
On your land,there is someone's house,<br>
It can be timid, scrawling mouse.<br>
Some of your grass is very rare,<br>
Which is grazed by white mare.<br>
And you are too bold;<br>
To give us freely the shining gold.<br>
The small children like to leap,<br>
In your leaves' heep.<br>
When it rains,<br>
We get delicious cairns.<br>
Your colourful stars glitter;<br>
And make everyone come out of their shelter.<br>
Many times you are a wonderful sight,<br>
And that scene is marvellous and right.<br>
There are many kinds of your animals,<br>
Some are avians,some are reptiles,some are mammals.<br>
In the daylight soars high the kite,<br>
Wheares owl toots at night.<br>
Oh,nature,you are so......colourful!<br>
And along with flowers,you are very beautiful!<br>
