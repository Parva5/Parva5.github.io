<h1 align=center>A nerd speaks</h1>

<font size=5>
Nerds is what we have been tagged<br>
Due to academic prizes we have bagged.<br>
You say, we haven't got sense of dress<br>
But unlike you, we seldom undergo stress.<br>
"Syllabus is not complete, exams to hell!<br>
Oh God, we are in a stressful shell."<br>
Are your words before every exam starts.<br>
But during exams, you cannot resist using our carts<br>
We help you in the exams by letting you copy<br>
And prevent your life from getting sloppy.<br>
All of you may flutter in your high esteem<br>
But remember, it was us who gave you the steam.<br>
You ridicule us for studying all day<br>
And so try to distract us from our way.<br>
But do mind that it is all<br>
Worthless as a cow in a mall.<br>
