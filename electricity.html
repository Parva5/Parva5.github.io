<h1 align=center>Electricity</h1>
<font size=5><center>
Electricity, in our daily life,<br>
Is as useful as spoon and knife;<br>
It lights up things and makes us feel nice,<br>
From night to morning, till we arise.<br>
Generated by thermal coal,<br>
Of our lives, it seldom takes toll.<br>
The tubelights, coolers and the fans,<br>
And ACs as well as the electric pans,<br>
Are few devices which run by it;<br>
It also makes houses and roads lit.<br>
From roadside beggars to wealthy man,<br>
To live without it, one hardly can.<br>
It is source of power for many things;<br>
Like a Sun for the realm of non-livings.<br>
But nowadays, it is wasted so much<br>
Power cuts have to be imposed, condition is such.<br>
So let us make its economical use,<br>
And about its wastage, we prevent ourselves to muse.<br>
