<h1 align=center>An incident</h1>
<center>
<font size=5>
This was an incident,when I was three,<br>
At the time when I was usually free.<br>
At that time I was also very naughty<br>
As I was naughty,so was haughty.<br>
So I went to buy clothes with my mother<br>
But I seemed to have attention on some other.<br>
Yes,it was an ugly girl in the shop,<br>
To whom I felt like giving a chop.<br>
It looked like she was four,<br>
But she wanted many, much, more.<br>
So at the mirror I dashed her head,<br>
In her unconciousness,she wade.<br>
But as she did not cry,<br>
I dashed her head for the second try.<br>
And over her head,emptied a bottle of powder;<br>
But as it had gone beyond the border,<br>
So I decided to run away,<br>
As I had to go a long way.<br>
Afterwards I thought she must have cried<br>
For I had been succesful in second try I tried!<br>
