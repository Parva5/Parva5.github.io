<h1 align=center>2008 Financial crisis</h1>
<center>
<font size=5>
The markets went down, down, down<br>
Powerful banks worried about their crown;<br>
For it was a crisis perpetrated by them,<br>
Which got the world in this jam.<br>
Housing loans, both prime and sub-prime<br>
Issued freely for quite a long time.<br>
Complex products based on these loans,<br>
Rendered worthless like a pile of stones.<br>
For defaults will happen if you give<br>
Irresponsible loans to create assets new<br>
And banks sold them to transfer the risk<br>
This cycle continued at pace brisk.<br>
Till one day, when this bubble burst<br>
There started the race to become the first;<br>
To remove these toxic assets from the books.<br>
Lured by money, they acted like crooks.<br>
Multi million dollar bonuses for these snobs<br>
Even though millions around the world lost their jobs.<br>
The public anger against them surged,<br>
As Lehman failed and Merrill merged<br>
Money, O money, so much greed you can brew<br>
Harming the many, benefiting the few.<br>
